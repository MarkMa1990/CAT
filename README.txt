The PBE Toolbox is an open-source software designed to solve population balance equations as they typically arise in particulate processes. 

Numerical Methods currently supported
- Moving Pivot
- Central Difference
- High Resolution

Features supported by all solvers
- Nucleation (homogeneous/heterogeneous)
- Growth (size dependent/independent)
- Antisolvent und Temperature profiles in form of anonymous functions or piecewise-linear functions
- Arbitrary grid sizing

Features that are currently planned
- GUI
- Dissolution
- Ostwald ripening
