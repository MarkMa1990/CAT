function [dxdt] = movingpivot(O, t, x)
%% [dxdt] = movingpivot(t, x, O) Moving Pivot method for Nucleation and Growth
% Solves the PBE according to the Moving Pivot method (cf. e.g.  Kumar, S.; Ramkrishna, D. Chemical Engineering Science 1997, 52, 4659ï¿½4679.)
% Needs to solve ODE's for number of particles (N), pivot length (y), boundaries (boundaries) and concentration,
% i.e. the number of ODE's to be solved is 3*ngrid-2+1 and has an event listener.
% In general, the moving pivot method yields the most accurate results but
% has the highest computational cost. The method is particularly well
% suited for problems with discontinuous distributions and geometric grids.
% If you are unhappy with the result consider the following options:
% - Increase the number of grid points
% - Decrease reltol {1e-6} and abstol {1e-6} [sol_options]
% - Reduce dL (criterion for bin addition) {10} [sol_options]
% - Use another method
